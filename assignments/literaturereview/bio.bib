abstract = {{This study uses longitudinal data on patients receiving percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to examine changes in outcomes and costs. All hospitals achieved substantial reductions in inpatient mortality and emergency bypass surgery over time, regardless of the number of procedures performed. Annual hospital procedure volume was also associated with improved outcomes, although the effect is small. There was no evidence that learning by doing (cumulative PTCA volume) influenced outcomes. The high correlation between annual and cumulative procedure volume precludes a point estimate of the effect of learning by doing on costs, although the upper bound on the potential learning effect is sizeable. The results suggest that centralizing provision of PTCA may lead to lower costs, but only small outcomes improvements.}},

We use a panel of antiulcer prescriptions from Italian physicians between 1990 and 1992 and focus on a new molecule available since 1990. We solve the model by calculating physicians' optimal decision rules as functions of their beliefs about the new pharmaceutical. According to our counterfactuals, physicians' initial pessimism and uncertainty can have large, negative effects on their propensity to prescribe the new drug and on expected health outcomes. In contrast, subsidizing the new good can mitigate informational losses. (JEL I10, L10)}},

We estimate a dynamic matching model of demand under uncertainty in which patients learn from prescription experience about the effectiveness of alternative drugs. Unlike previous models, we allow drugs to have distinct symptomatic and curative effects, and endogenize treatment length by allowing drug choices to affect patients' underlying probability of recovery. We find that drugs' rankings along these dimensions differ, with high symptomatic effects for drugs with the highest market shares and high curative effects for drugs with the greatest medical efficacy. Our results also indicate that while there is substantial heterogeneity in drug efficacy across patients, learning enables patients and their doctors to dramatically reduce the costs of uncertainty in pharmaceutical markets.}},

To separately identify the impacts of effectiveness and side effects, we augment the observed prescription choices with unique data on self-reported reasons for switching in our estimation. Results show that the two new drugs Levitra and Cialis have higher mean effectiveness than the existing drug Viagra, but physicians have large uncertainty regarding the effectiveness for Levitra and side effects for Cialis. Detailing is effective in reducing the uncertainty for effectiveness but much less so for side effects. Based on the results, we investigate the roles of effectiveness and side effects in physicians' prescription choices, and the importance of detailing for new entrants in competing with incumbent drugs.
